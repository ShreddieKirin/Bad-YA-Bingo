Currently, there are 2 card types: Bad YA Fantasy Romance and Bad YA Paranormal Romance. Each have 3 separate sets which differently shuffle 100 spaces onto 4 different cards. I might compile a list of all the spaces later.

Tbh I don't have much knowledge of how github works. I just needed a place to drop these, and Dropbox wanted to charge me money.
